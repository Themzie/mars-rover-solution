# mars-rover-solution
This project will focus on developing a controller to guide a rover across Martian terrain from its current location to the home base. The controller will be developed to use two key elements which are: i. Telemetry data that the controller receives from the rover ii. A Martian terrain domain expert artificial intelligence component to direct the movements of the rover until it safely reaches the home base.
